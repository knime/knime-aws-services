    <name>DynamoDB Batch Delete</name>
    <shortDescription>
        Deletes data from DynamoDB by hash and range key.
    </shortDescription>

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
        <p>
        This nodes deletes items in DynamoDB that match a given hash and optional range key in a KNIME table.
        </p>
        <p>
        The command sent to DynamoDB by this node is BatchWriteItem, with a single batch deleting
        at most 25 items, so deleting a large amount of data may take a while. The individual
        delete operations on item level are atomic, but the operation is not atomic on batch
        or even node execution level. That means if the node fails in-between, some of the items
        may have been deleted and others not.
        </p>
        <p>
        If DynamoDB throttles the requests due to insufficient
        provisioned capacity units, unprocessed items are included in the next request.
        Additionally this node employs exponential backoff if throttling occurs. Each time a request
        cannot be completed fully, the next request is sent after a waiting time of 2&#94;nRetry * 100 milliseconds.
        Once a request can be executed completely, the retry counter is reset.
        However, if no item can be deleted, the node fails and you have to increase the provisioned write
        capacity units on the table.

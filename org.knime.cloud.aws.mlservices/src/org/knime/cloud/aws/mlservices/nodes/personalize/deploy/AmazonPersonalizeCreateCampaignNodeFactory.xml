	<name>Amazon Personalize Create Campaign</name>
	<shortDescription>Creates a new Amazon Personalize solution version.
	</shortDescription>
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This node deploys a solution version by creating a new campaign. The
			created campaign can then be used to make predictions. You need to
			have at least one solution version created to create a campaign. You
			can use the
			<i>Amazon Personalize Create Solution Version</i>
			node for this.
			<br />
			More
			information is available on the
			<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/personalize/">website</a>
			or in the
			<a
				href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/personalize-dg.pdf">documentation</a>.
			<br />
			<br />
			<i>Note:
				If
				the
				node execution is interrupted
				during
				the
				creation, e.g. by
				the user or due to lost of internet connection, the creation
				will
				still
				be
				completed
				on
				AWS,
				although the node does not execute
				successfully.
